Description: Computes a universal numeric fingerprint (UNF) for an R data
    object. UNF is a cryptographic hash or signature that can be used to uniquely
    identify (a version of) a rectangular dataset, or a subset thereof. UNF can
    be used, in tandem with a DOI, to form a persistent citation to a versioned
    dataset.
